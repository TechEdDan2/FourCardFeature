## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile First - I started with the mobile view and then changed to desktop.
- Bootstrap - I just played around with bootstrap a little here, but ended up removing it. 

### What I learned

This was good practice for layout.

### Continued development

I would like to try this using a framework or other approach in the future to practice those skills. I started to use Bootstrap, but ended up taking it out. I would also like to figure out how others determined spacing and size of the elements. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) - This always helps
